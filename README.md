## Project 1: [Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/36c1c052-ae58-4bf7-96cb-cbf58deb27f0)

Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining.

As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.

If we're going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first we'll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. 


## Project 2: [The GitHub History of the Scala Language](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/c5120331-0956-403d-aab7-340154951afd)

With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.


## Project 3: Data Science Salary Estimator

* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask


## Project 4: Drive your career to new heights 

Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.
In this project will be builded a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. I will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane.


## Project 5: Color Detection with Python

Build an application to detect colors.

How many times has it occurred to you that even after seeing, you don’t remember the name of the color? There can be 16 million colors based on the different RGB color values but we only remember a few. So in this project, we are going to build an interactive app that will detect the selected color from any image. To implement this we will need a labeled data of all the known colors then we will calculate which color resembles the most with the selected color value.


## Project 6: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

In this project, we build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
