# Data-Science-Projects

## Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator

* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask

## Project 2: Drive your career to new heights 

Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.
In this project will be builded a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. I will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane.

## Project 3: Color Detection with Python

Build an application to detect colors.

How many times has it occurred to you that even after seeing, you don’t remember the name of the color? There can be 16 million colors based on the different RGB color values but we only remember a few. So in this project, we are going to build an interactive app that will detect the selected color from any image. To implement this we will need a labeled data of all the known colors then we will calculate which color resembles the most with the selected color value.

## Project 4: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

In this project, we build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
